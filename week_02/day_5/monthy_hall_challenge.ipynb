    "\n",
    "In a game show, contestants try to guess which of the three closed doors contain a cash prize (goats are behind the other two doors). Of course, the odds of choosing the correct door are 1 in 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a twist! The host of the show, Mr. Monty Hall, always opens a door after a contestant makes their choice. This door is always one of the two that the contestant did not pick. Behind the opened door, there is a goat. Leaving only two doors unopened, with one of them being the original door that the contestant picked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the host asks the contestant if they would like to switch their door of choice to the other unopened door. They have the option to keep their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, should the contestant switch to the other door? Is there any statistical benefit? \n",

    "------------\n",

    "We can answer the problem by running simulations in Python. We'll do it in several parts.\n",

    "First, write a function called `simulate_prizedoor`. This function will simulate the location of the prize in many games -- see the detailed specification below:"
