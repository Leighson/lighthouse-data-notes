    "- For one, it does not take into consideration the popularity of a movie. Therefore, a movie with a rating of 9 from 10 voters will be considered 'better' than a movie with a rating of 8.9 from 10,000 voters.\n",
    "- On a related note, this metric will also tend to favor movies with a smaller number of voters with skewed and/or extremely high ratings. As the number of voters increases, the rating of a movie regularizes and approaches towards a value that is reflective of the movie's quality and gives the user a much better idea as to which movie he/she should choose. While it is difficult to discern the quality of a movie with extremely few voters, you might have to consider external sources to conclude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking these shortcomings into consideration, you must come up with a weighted rating that takes into account the average rating and the number of votes it has accumulated. Such a system will make sure that a movie with a 9 rating from 100,000 voters gets a (far) higher score than a movie with the same rating but a mere few hundred voters.\n",

You can consider it as a preliminary negative filter that will simply remove the movies which have a number of votes less than a certain threshold `m`. The selectivity of your filter is up to your discretion.\n",
