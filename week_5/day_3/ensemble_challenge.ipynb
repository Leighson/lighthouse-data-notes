    "This dataset represents sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store are available. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.\n",

    "|: ------------- |:-------------|\n",
    "|Item_Identifier|Unique product ID|\n",
    "|Item_Weight|Weight of product|\n",
    "|Item_Fat_Content|Whether the product is low fat or not|\n",
    "|Item_Visibility|The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product|\n",
    "|Item_Type|The category to which the product belongs|\n",

    "|Outlet_Size|The size of the store in terms of ground area covered|\n",

    "4. Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis\n",
