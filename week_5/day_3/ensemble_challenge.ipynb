    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "This dataset represents sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store are available. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Variable|Description|\n",
    "| ------------- |-------------|\n",
    "|Item_Identifier|Unique product ID|\n",
    "|Item_Weight|Weight of product|\n",
    "|Item_Fat_Content|Whether the product is low fat or not|\n",
    "|Item_Visibility|The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product|\n",
    "|Item_Type|The category to which the product belongs|\n",
    "|Item_MRP|Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product|\n",
    "|Outlet_Identifier|Unique store ID|\n",
    "|Outlet_Establishment_Year|The year in which store was established|\n",
    "|Outlet_Size|The size of the store in terms of ground area covered|\n",
    "|Outlet_Location_Type|The type of city in which the store is located|\n",
    "|Outlet_Type|Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket|\n",
    "|Item_Outlet_Sales|Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.|\n",

    "Please note that the data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Hypothesis Generation – understanding the problem better by brainstorming possible factors that can impact the outcome\n",
    "2. Data Exploration – looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.\n",
    "3. Data Cleaning – imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis\n",
    "5. Model Building – making predictive models on the data"
