    "**TASK 1**: Build a pipeline that ends with a regression model, to predict `Item_Outlet_Sales` from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The pipeline should have following steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the features into numerical and categorical (text)\n",
    "2. Replace null values\n",
    "    - the mean for numerical variables\n",
    "    - the most frequent value for categorical variables\n",
    "3. Create dummy variables from categorical features\n",
    "4. Use a PCA to reduce number of dummy variables to 3 principal components. PCA will be used directly after the OneHotEncoder that outputs data into a SparseMatrix, so we will need to use the **ToDenseTransformer** from the [article about custom pipelines](https://queirozf.com/entries/scikit-learn-pipelines-custom-pipelines-and-pandas-integration).\n",
    "5. Select the 3 best candidates from the original numerical features using KBest\n",
    "6. Fit a Ridge regression (default alpha is fine for now)\n",

    "**TASK 2**: Tune the parameters of multiple models as well as the preprocessing steps and find the best solution.\n",
    "- Try these models: \n",
    "        - Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "        - Gradient Boosting Regressor \n",
    "        - Ridge Regression. \n",
    "- For the task 2, we will need to use the same approach from this [earlier article](https://iaml.it/blog/optimizing-sklearn-pipelines), in the section `PIPELINE TUNING (ADVANCED VERSION)`, where we tried different kinds of scalers. (Use the article as reference.)\n",
